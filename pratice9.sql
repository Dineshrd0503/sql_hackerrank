-- Question: Find the Last Time Each Bike Was in Use
--
-- Problem Statement:
-- You are tasked with finding the last time each bike was in use. For each bike, output the bike number
-- and the date-timestamp of its last use (i.e., the date-time the bike was returned). Order the results
-- by bikes that were most recently used, meaning the bike with the latest return time should appear first.
--
-- Tables and Schema:
-- The table is named `bike_usage` and has the following schema:
--
-- Table: bike_usage
-- | Column Name   | Data Type      |
-- |---------------|----------------|
-- | bike_number   | bigint         |
-- | return_time   | datetime       |
--
-- Notes:
-- - The `bike_number` column uniquely identifies each bike.
-- - The `return_time` column represents the date-timestamp when the bike was returned, indicating its
--   last use.
-- - Additional columns (e.g., start_time, user_id) may exist but are not needed for this query.
-- - Assume at least one record exists per bike, and `return_time` is non-NULL.
-- - If multiple records have the same `return_time` for a bike, selecting one is sufficient.
-- - The current date is June 19, 2025, but it is not needed for this query as no calculations are
--   performed relative to the current date.
--
-- Requirements:
-- - Output columns: `bike_number`, `last_used` (the date-timestamp of the last use).
-- - Order the results by bikes that were most recently used (i.e., by `last_used` in descending order).
-- - Use a `GROUP BY` approach to find the most recent `return_time` per bike, inspired by the question
--   about using `ORDER BY`.
--
-- Solution:
--
SELECT bike_number, MAX(return_time) AS last_used
FROM bike_usage
GROUP BY bike_number
ORDER BY last_used DESC;

-- Explanation of the Code:
--
-- The query uses a `GROUP BY` approach to find the most recent return time for each bike and sorts
-- the results by the most recent usage. Here's a detailed breakdown:
--
-- 1. SELECT Clause:
--    - `bike_number`: Outputs the unique identifier for each bike.
--    - `MAX(return_time) AS last_used`: Computes the most recent return timestamp for each bike,
--      aliased as `last_used` for clarity in the output.
--
-- 2. GROUP BY bike_number:
--    - Groups records by `bike_number`, ensuring one row per bike.
--    - The `MAX(return_time)` function aggregates within each group to select the latest timestamp.
--
-- 3. ORDER BY last_used DESC:
--    - Sorts the results by the `last_used` column (maximum `return_time`) in descending order.
--    - Using `DESC` ensures bikes with the most recent return times appear first, as required by
--      "order by bikes that were most recently used." For example, a bike returned on
--      2025-06-19 15:00:00 appears before one returned on 2025-06-18 10:00:00.
--
-- 4. Assumptions and Considerations:
--    - Assumes the `bike_usage` table exists with `bike_number` (bigint) and `return_time` (datetime).
--    - Assumes `return_time` is non-NULL; if NULLs exist, a `WHERE return_time IS NOT NULL` clause
--      could be added before `GROUP BY`.
--    - If multiple records for a bike have the same `return_time`, `MAX` selects one arbitrarily,
--      which is sufficient per the problem.
--    - The query is compatible with standard SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
--
-- 5. Why DESC for ORDER BY?
--    - The requirement "order by bikes that were most recently used" means sorting by the latest
--      `return_time`. In SQL, descending order (`DESC`) places higher (more recent) timestamps first,
--      while ascending order (`ASC`) would prioritize older timestamps, which would incorrectly order
--      bikes used least recently first.
--
-- 6. Alternative Approach:
--    - A window function approach using `ROW_NUMBER()` could be used for greater flexibility, especially
--      if additional columns from the most recent record are needed:
--      ```
--      WITH RankedRecords AS (
--          SELECT 
--              bike_number,
--              return_time,
--              ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY bike_number ORDER BY return_time DESC) AS rn
--          FROM bike_usage
--      )
--      SELECT bike_number, return_time AS last_used
--      FROM RankedRecords
--      WHERE rn = 1
--      ORDER BY last_used DESC;
--      ```
--    - The `GROUP BY` solution is chosen for simplicity, as it directly meets the requirement
--      without additional complexity.
--
-- Order of Execution:
--
-- 1. FROM bike_usage:
--    - Accesses the `bike_usage` table.
--
-- 2. GROUP BY bike_number:
--    - Groups records by `bike_number`, creating one group per bike.
--
-- 3. SELECT bike_number, MAX(return_time):
--    - Outputs `bike_number` and computes the maximum `return_time` within each group, aliased as
--      `last_used`.
--
-- 4. ORDER BY last_used DESC:
--    - Sorts the result by `last_used` in descending order, placing bikes with the most recent
--      return times first.
--
-- 5. Output:
--    - A table with columns `bike_number` and `last_used`, sorted by `last_used` DESC.
--
-- Expected Output:
--
-- Assuming the following sample data in `bike_usage`:
-- | bike_number | return_time         |
-- |-------------|---------------------|
-- | 1           | 2025-06-18 10:00:00 |
-- | 1           | 2025-06-19 12:00:00 |
-- | 2           | 2025-06-17 15:00:00 |
-- | 3           | 2025-06-19 08:00:00 |
--
-- Result:
-- | bike_number | last_used           |
-- |-------------|---------------------|
-- | 1           | 2025-06-19 12:00:00 |
-- | 3           | 2025-06-19 08:00:00 |
-- | 2           | 2025-06-17 15:00:00 |
--
-- Explanation:
-- - Bike 1 was last used on 2025-06-19 12:00:00 (most recent).
-- - Bike 3 was last used on 2025-06-19 08:00:00 (second most recent).
-- - Bike 2 was last used on 2025-06-17 15:00:00 (least recent among these).
-- - The `ORDER BY last_used DESC` ensures Bike 1 appears first, followed by Bike 3, then Bike 2.
--
-- Notes:
--
-- - Database Compatibility:
--   - The query uses standard SQL (`GROUP BY`, `MAX`, `ORDER BY`), compatible with MySQL,
--     PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.
--   - Ensure `return_time` is a `datetime` or `timestamp` type in the database.
--
-- - Edge Cases:
--   - Empty Table: Returns no rows (handled implicitly).
--   - Ties: If multiple records for a bike have the same `return_time`, `MAX` selects one
--     arbitrarily. For deterministic tie-breaking, the window function approach could add
--     criteria (e.g., `ORDER BY return_time DESC, bike_number`).
--   - NULL Values: Assumes `return_time` is non-NULL. If NULLs exist, add
--     `WHERE return_time IS NOT NULL` before `GROUP BY`.
--
-- - Performance:
--   - Indexes on `bike_number` and `return_time` improve efficiency, especially for large
--     datasets. A composite index on `(bike_number, return_time DESC)` would optimize the
--     `GROUP BY` and `MAX` operations.
--
-- - Alternative Sorting:
--   - If "most recently used" was misinterpreted to mean oldest first, `ORDER BY last_used ASC`
--     could be used, but `DESC` aligns with the problem's intent.
--
-- - Practice Platforms:
--   - This problem is common in SQL practice platforms, often under "group-wise maximum" or
--     "latest record" categories. Similar problems can be found on:
--     - LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/study-plan/sql/ (e.g., "Department Highest Salary")
--     - HackerRank: https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql (e.g., "Weather Observation Station")
--     - StrataScratch: https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding (search for "latest record")
--     - SQLZoo: https://sqlzoo.net/ (e.g., "SELECT within SELECT")
--     - DataLemur: https://datalemur.com/questions (e.g., "Latest Transaction")
--   - These platforms have problems requiring `GROUP BY` or window functions to select the most
--     recent record per group, adaptable to bike usage scenarios.
--
-- This solution meets the requirement of finding the last usage time for each bike, using a
-- `GROUP BY` approach with `ORDER BY ... DESC` to sort by most recent usage, and provides a
-- clear, portable SQL query.
